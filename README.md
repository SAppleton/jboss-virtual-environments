jboss-virtual-environments
==========================

[vagrant] machines for working with JBoss products

We have:
  - base-boxes: to create base systems to then add products. These base boxes are created with [packer].
  - vagrant-vms: Virtual machines with different setups and products installed to demonstrate some functionality
